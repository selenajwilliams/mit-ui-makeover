                    <strong>About Virtual Events</strong><br/>
                    Please add these important <em><strong>virtual</strong></em> event dates into your calendar. The event goal is to provide more information about graduate school in EECS at MIT. The chair of EECS graduate admissions will host the discussions, and will offer an overview of the EECS department and the graduate admission process. Together with some EECS PhD alumni, you will hear (i) if the PhD journey is worthwhile, (ii) advice about what they might have done differently, and (iii) what opportunities become possible with a PhD degree.
